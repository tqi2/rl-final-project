Solve maze problem using Deep Q Network

# Overview

This is the final project for Reinforcement Learning course at USF. The problem we are solving is to train an agent to learn the correct route through a maze using Deep Q Network.

# Dependencies

Building the maze environment is not the core of this course, we modified the lvidarte[https://github.com/lvidarte/maze] and Derek Vidovic [http://new.math.uiuc.edu/math198/MA198-2012/vidovic2/python/Maze.py] scripts which were built under *Tkinter* to make the specific environment for our problem.

# Result

A gif result will be posted later
